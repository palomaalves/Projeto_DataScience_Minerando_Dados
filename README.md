Projetos práticos envolvendo Data Science e Machine Learning
Foram praticados métodos e técnicas aplicadas a base de dados escolhida.

In this project I used supervised learning techniques to dataset to predict the price of houses and finding out the factors that effect the housing market in Boston.

Base de dados- Boston Housing Data Set This is another popular dataset used in pattern recognition literature. The data set comes from the real estate industry in Boston (US). This is a regression problem. The data has 506 rows and 14 columns. Thus, it’s a fairly small data set where you can attempt any technique without worrying about your laptop’s memory being overused
